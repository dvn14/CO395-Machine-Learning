## Coursework 1: Decision Trees

### Abstract 

This report covers our implementation of decisions trees that determines emotions from input vectors of Action Units. The code was written in MATLAB and evaluation of the performance of our implementation was also done in MATLAB. An analysis is given within, along with some answers to some questions posed in the coursework specification.

### Introduction

Emotion recognition is something most people do effortlessly, our brains can perform this subconsciously. People can usually immediately tell whether the person they see is happy, sad, or angry, yet it is very difficult to make a machine perform the same task. Even with advanced facial feature recognition, standard algorithms are not always up to the task. Machine learning offers a potential solution to this problem, as instead of formulating a complicated computer program, the machine can learn to distinguish different emotions, much like a real person would.

For this task, we were given examples of 6 basic emotions - anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise - and their corresponding facial expressions described using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). It splits up images of the human face into multiple smaller sections, allowing for easier identification of which muscles, or Action Units, are being used for any given expression. There were around 1000 examples, using which the algorithm would be both taught and evaluated.
